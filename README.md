Purpose
--------

Under Linux, the **jHiccup** script can be used to bind to and monitor a given java program. But under Windows, that is not the case. The purpose of this repository is to provide tools to support monitoring of selected
Java programs under Windows. 

Contents
---------

 - **logProcessor.bat** : Converts the output file generated by jHiccup in to a human readable format. Generates the **.log** and the **.hprf** files that can be imported in to **jHiccupPlotter** that comes bundled with jHiccup.
 - **JBossEAP - Version 6.2.0.GA** : Contains the standalone.bat file present in jBoss **bin** folder. It has been modified to run jHiccup as a Java agent with jBoss. The version of the jBoss server that the file was taken from is **JBoss Enterprise Application Platform - Version 6.2.0.GA**. The changed line is as follows.

```sh
"%JAVA%" -javaagent:jHiccup.jar="-l hiccuplog" %JAVA_OPTS% ^
 "-Dorg.jboss.boot.log.file=%JBOSS_LOG_DIR%\server.log" ^
 "-Dlogging.configuration=file:%JBOSS_CONFIG_DIR%/logging.properties" ^
    -jar "%JBOSS_HOME%\jboss-modules.jar" ^
    -mp "%JBOSS_MODULEPATH%" ^
    -jaxpmodule "javax.xml.jaxp-provider" ^
     org.jboss.as.standalone ^
    "-Djboss.home.dir=%JBOSS_HOME%" ^
     %SERVER_OPTS%
```
